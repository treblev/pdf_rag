Epic Games’ Administrative Motion to Seal (Week 2) (Dkt. No. 660)\\n\\nThe motion is GRANTED as to all documents except for:\\n\\nDX-4800\\n\\no See above in the Apple section for the appropriate redactions. DX-5549 and DX-5550\\n\\no The Court has reviewed Spotify’s declaration in support of the sealing of\\n\\ncertain information in these documents. (See Dkt. Nos. 680 (declaration),\\n\\n681 (proposed redactions).) The Court approves of Spotify’s proposed\\n\\nredactions of these documents, which are narrowly tailored. d. Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC’s Administrative Motion to Seal (Dkt. No. 663)\\n\\nHaving reviewed Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC’s renewed administrative motion to\\n\\nseal, the Court will follow the example set by Judge Lucy Koh in Apple, Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., No. 11-CV-01846-LHK, 2012 WL 3283478, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 9, 2012), rev’d and\\n\\nremanded on other grounds, 727 F.3d 1214 (Fed.

       " Document(page_content='2013). The Court considers the extent to\\n\\nwhich the inadvertently disclosed documents have been publicized, weighs the public’s right of\\n\\naccess to these documents considering the merits of this action, and balances these considerations\\n\\nagainst any potential competitive harm to Sony. The motion is therefore GRANTED as follows:\\n\\nDX-3660 (Ex. A)\\n\\no Although this agreement was identified as one document that was\\n\\ninadvertently disclosed by the parties, the Court agrees to limited proposed\\n\\nredactions. Thus, the proposed redactions are sealed except as follows:\\n\\n\\uf0a7 Section 1.2: The sentence defining “Competitive Platform” shall be\\n\\nunredacted. The remainder in this section is otherwise sealed. 5\\n\\nCase 4:20-cv-05640-YGR Document 715 Filed 05/20/21 Page 6 of 8\\n\\n\\uf0a7 The remainder of the document is otherwise appropriately\\n\\nunredacted. DX-3865 (Ex. B)\\n\\no The section titled “Gift card economics” shall be sealed. The remainder of\\n\\nthis email shall be unredacted. DX-3988 (Ex. C) / DX-4519 (Ex. F)\\n\\no Sony admits that DX-3988 is a duplicate document of DX-4519, which was\\n\\ninadvertently disclosed. The Court agrees to limited proposed redactions,\\n\\nwhich request sealing of specialized terms in an agreement between Epic\\n\\nGames and Sony. DX-4425 (Ex.', metadata={'source': '/home/treblev/Coding/GitHub/pdf_rag/source_docs/Epic-v.-Apple-20-cv-05640-YGR-Dkt-715-Trial-Order-7.pdf'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='D) / DX-3582 (Ex. J)\\n\\no Sony admits that DX-4425 is substantively similar to DX-3582, which was\\n\\ninadvertently disclosed. The Court agrees to limited proposed redactions,\\n\\nwhich request sealing of specialized terms in an agreement between Epic\\n\\nGames and Sony. DX-4493 (Ex. E)\\n\\no Although this agreement was identified as one document that was\\n\\ninadvertently disclosed by the parties, the Court agrees to the limited\\n\\nproposed redactions by Sony. DX-3094 (Ex. G)\\n\\no This request is DENIED. First, portions of this document remain readily\\n\\naccessible to the public.3 Second, as the Court also reasoned in Trial Order\\n\\n1, the Court will not seal general terms applicable to all developers who\\n\\nwish to sell on a gaming platform.

The same reasoning is true here, where the document is a\\n\\ngeneral policy applicable to any developer who wishes to sell on the Sony\\n\\nPlayStation platform, and such a policy is widely disseminated to the\\n\\ndeveloper community. Moreover, this document is highly relevant to the\\n\\nCourt’s analysis in assessing where competition exists in this action. DX-3125 (Ex. H)\\n\\no Tim Sweeney’s statements on June 2, 2018 shall be unredacted. The\\n\\nremainder of the proposed redactions shall be sealed. DX-3433 (Ex. I)\\n\\no This request is DENIED. The proposed redactions are overbroad, especially\\n\\nwhere this document is (1) more than three years old, (2) is highly relevant\\n\\nto the Court’s analysis in assessing where competition exists in this action,\\n\\nand (3) portions of which are readily accessible to the public.4 Thus, the\\n\\ndocument shall be entirely unredacted. Regarding the unredacted documents above: these documents, or portions thereof, do not\\n\\nreveal information which is so confidential as to be damaging if revealed as balanced against the\\n\\nneed for public access to the factual issues underlying this case. Sony shall provide the parties\\n\\nwith revised redacted versions of the documents which may be used in any public portion of the\\n\\ntrial. e. Nintendo of America, Inc.’s Administrative Motion to Seal (Dkt. No. 705)\\n\\nThe Court GRANTS non-party Nintendo of America, Inc’s administrative motion to seal the\\n\\nproposed redactions in its specific agreement with Epic Games. The Court finds that the requested\\n\\nsealing is narrowly tailored, and that the public’s right of access to this sealed document is\\n\\noutweighed by any competitive harm that would be incurred by Nintendo by the release of the\\n\\nunredacted version of the agreement. 4 See supra n.3. 7\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\nt r u o C\\n\\nt c i r t s i D s e t a t S d e t i n U\\n\\na i n r o f i l a C\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt c i r t s i D n r e h t r o N\\n\\nCase 4:20-cv-05640-YGR Document 715 Filed 05/20/21 Page 8 of 8\\n\\nf.

No. 665.) As discussed above, the Court has addressed\\n\\nthe sealing of DX-4800. With regard to DX-4322, the Court agrees that this document is\\n\\nappropriately sealed in its entirety.

The same reasoning is true here, where the document is a\\n\\ngeneral policy applicable to any developer who wishes to sell on the Sony\\n\\nPlayStation platform, and such a policy is widely disseminated to the\\n\\ndeveloper community.

Regarding the unredacted documents above: these documents, or portions thereof, do not\\n\\nreveal information which is so confidential as to be damaging if revealed as balanced against the\\n\\nneed for public access to the factual issues underlying this case.

The Court finds that the requested\\n\\nsealing is narrowly tailored, and that the public’s right of access to this sealed document is\\n\\noutweighed by any competitive harm that would be incurred by Nintendo by the release of the\\n\\nunredacted version of the agreement. 4 See supra n.3. 7\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n27\\n\\n28\\n\\nt r u o C\\n\\nt c i r t s i D s e t a t S d e t i n U\\n\\na i n r o f i l a C\\n\\nf o\\n\\nt c i r t s i D n r e h t r o N\\n\\nCase 4:20-cv-05640-YGR Document 715 Filed 05/20/21 Page 8 of 8\\n\\nf.
